    <s>On a time a countrymouse is reported to have received a city-mouse into his <word mood = "neg" loc = "country" sp = "narrator">poor</word> cave, an old
        host, his old acquaintance; a blunt fellow and attentive to his acquisitions, yet so as he
        could [on occasion] enlarge his narrow soul in acts of hospitality. </s>
    <s>What need of many words?</s>
    <s>He neither grudged him the hoarded vetches, nor the long oats; and bringing in his mouth a
        dry plum, and nibbled scraps of bacon, presented them to him, being desirous by the variety
        of the supper to get the better of the daintiness of his guest, who hardly touched with his
        delicate tooth the several things: while the father of the family himself, extended on fresh
        straw, ate a spelt and darnel, leaving that which was better [for his guest].</s>
    <s>At length the citizen addressing him, ‘Friend,’ says he, ‘what delight have you to live
        <word mood = "neg" loc = "country" sp="citymouse">laboriously</word> on the ridge of a <word mood="neg" loc="country" sp ="citymouse">rugged thicket</word>?</s>
    <s>Will you not prefer men and the city to the <word mood = "pos" loc = "country" sp = "citymouse">savage woods?</word></s>
    <s>Take my advice, and go along with me: since mortal lives are allotted to all terrestrial
        animals, nor is there any escape from death, either for the great or the small.</s>
    <s>Wherefore, my good friend, while it is in your power, live happy in joyous circumstances:
        live mindful of how brief an existence you are.’</s>
    <s>Soon as these speeches had wrought upon the peasant, he leaps nimbly from his cave: thence
        they both pursue their intended journey, being desirous to steal under the city walls by
        night.</s>
    <s>And now the night possessed the middle region of the heavens, when each of them set foot in a
        <word mood="pos" loc="city" sp="narrator">gorgeous</word> <word mood="pos" loc="city" sp="narrator">palace</word>, where carpets dyed with crimson grain <word mood="pos" loc="city" sp="narrator">glittered</word> upon <word mood="pos" loc="city" sp="narrator">ivory</word> couches, and
        many baskets of a <word mood="pos" loc="city" sp="narrator">magnificent</word> entertainment remained, which had yesterday been set by in
        baskets piled upon one another.</s>
    <s>After he had placed the peasant then, stretched at ease, upon a <word mood="pos" loc="city" sp="narrator">splendid</word> carpet; he bustles
        about like an adroit host, and keeps bringing up one dish close upon another, and with an
        affected civility performs all the ceremonies, first tasting of every thing he serves
        up.</s>
    <s>He, reclined, rejoices in the change of his situation, and acts the part of a boon companion
        in the good cheer: when on a sudden a prodigious rattling of the folding doors shook them
        both from their couches.</s>
    <s><word mood="neg" loc="city" sp="narrator">Terrified</word> they began to scamper all about the room, and more and more heartless to be in
        confusion, while the lofty house resounded with [the barking of] mastiff dogs; upon which,
        says the country-mouse, ‘I have no desire for a life like this; and so farewell: my wood and
        cave, <word mood="pos" loc="country" sp="countrymouse">secure</word> from surprises, shall with <word mood="pos" loc="country" sp ="countrymouse">homely</word> tares comfort me.’</s>
